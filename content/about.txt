TITLE: About Me
---------------
My name is Richard Merry and am I am a software developer by trade. Originally from Leeds in the UK, I studied a Masters in Computing at the University of York. I am currently living and working in Berlin, Germany.

In my spare time I love tinkering on a computer; I'm an Linux fan and an avid Vim user. I consider myself a polyglot developer, having no affiliation with any particular programming language.

When I'm not on a computer you can probably find me moping around in a pub somewhere, or perhaps rambling on some hills and pastures.
